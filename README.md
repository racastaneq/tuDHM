# tuDHM â€“ Telecentric Uniform Digital Holographic Microscopy

tuDHM is a collection of MATLAB and Python scripts developed for phase compensation in off-axis Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) under telecentric uniform configurations. The compensation is achieved through heuristic optimization of a custom cost function, enabling more accurate and robust phase retrieval from digital holograms.

## Overview
In off-axis DHM, the reconstruction of the object phase requires isolating and demodulating the +1 diffraction order in the Fourier domain. The tuDHM scripts go one step further by optimizing a digital reference wave that minimizes phase artifacts caused by misalignment, aberrations, or residual carrier fringes.

This framework is especially useful for high-precision phase imaging, such as in biological or microfluidic samples.
